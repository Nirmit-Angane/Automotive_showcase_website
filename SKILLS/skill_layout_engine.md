# SKILL: Layout Engine

## Core Principles
1.  **Asymmetry**: Avoid perfect centering. Balance mass with void.
2.  **Overlap**: Elements should aggressively overlap (text over image, image over text).
3.  **Verticality**: Emphasize vertical rhythm with tall, narrow columns.

## Component Structures
- **Hero**: Full-screen video/carousel with massive overlay text.
- **Grid**: auto-fit/auto-fill with `minmax(300px, 1fr)`.
- **Card**: Raw image + data overlay. No padding.
